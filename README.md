The file Analytical_Formalism.ipynb is a self contained version of the charged metric Blackhawk code using the geometric optics approximation. It runs analogously to the BlackHawk spinning and static cases, except the program is extended to included changing charge. 

Feel free to reach out to cewasiuk@ucsc.edu for any questions regarding getting the code to run.
