The contents of this folder include the entirety of BlackHawk including multiple files to recompute the page factors for spin and mass loss. The original contents of Blackhawk are slightly edited to include dark particles of varying degrees of freedom.


The file Analytical_Formalism.ipynb is a self contained version of the charged metric Blackhawk code using the geometric optics approximation. It runs analogously to the BlackHawk spinning and static cases, except the program is extended to included changing charge. 

Feel free to reach out to cewasiuk@ucsc.edu for any questions regarding getting the code to run.
